    <h1>Of Sound Mind: Code of Conduct</h1>
    <p>
      Joining a SOUND fleet or SOUND comms? Go read the
      <a href="#rules">rules</a>!
    </p>
    <h2><a name="applicable" href="#applicable">#</a> Applicability</h2>
    <p>
      This document outlines the behavior expected of SOUND members and guests.
      The "Rules" section applies to <b>everyone</b> (even non-SOUND members)
      in all SOUND-run spaces. Repeated violations of the rules will generally
      result in immediate removal.
    </p>
    <p>
      For SOUND members, the Rules section also applies in non-SOUND spaces
      where other SOUND members are present, and the additional "Principles"
      section applies. The Principles are enforced less stringently than the
      Rules.
    </p>
    <h2><a name="rules" href="#rules">#</a> Rules</h2>
    If one of these is unclear to you, ask a director or #safe for help.
    <p>
      The following are <b>never allowed</b>, regardless of whether you are
      being sincere or ironic:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Racism</li>
      <li>Sexism</li>
      <li>Homophobia</li>
      <li>Transphobia</li>
      <li>Harassment</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The following specific things, while common in other Eve & gaming
      contexts, are <b>not allowed</b>:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use of 'gay' and similar as synonyms for 'uncool'</li>
      <li>Use of 'jew' and similar as synonyms for 'carebear'</li>
      <li>Use of 'bitch' and similar for any reason</li>
      <li>Use of 'rape' and related verbs/terms for any reason</li>
      <li>Nationalism/racism, either of the 'USA #1!' or 'so-and-so race/ethnic
group/... are all drunks' type</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We also do not allow and <b>will immediately ban you</b> for:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Posting RL information about other players (doxxing)</li>
      <li>Either selling or buying ISK for real currency (RMT)</li>
      <li>Automating the Eve client (botting)</li>
      <li>Out-of-game disruption of another group (DoS or hacking)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Deliberate attempts to either "lawyer" (by following the letter but not
      the spirit) or "edgelord" (by toeing the line) these rules will be dealt
      with harshly.
    </p>

    <h2><a name="principles" href="#principles">#</a> Principles</h2>
    <p>
      <b>Listening</b>: This is the most important principle. If a corpmate
      tells you something you're doing is bothering them, listen! Stop the
      behavior right away <b>even if you think you aren't doing anything
      wrong</b>. If you need help resolving a disagreement with a corpmate about
      whether something is acceptable, ask for help in #safe on Slack, or ask
      any director.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Trash talk</b>: we do not generally do this, but you are free to if you
      want. However, this should stay lighthearted and not be mean-spirited;
      we are playing a video game and the other players are not your real-life
      enemies.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Local spam</b>: we generally do not spam in Local (pasting the same
      message over & over, pasting ASCII art, etc) or in other in-game channels.
      A coordinated "gf" after an engagement or a "never bend the knee!" after
      a fight with CVA are fine, though. Use your judgment.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Drinking/drugs</b>: while it is (unlike in real life) fine to drink
      and fly or "fly high", you are still expected to abide by this code,
      regardless of how intoxicated you are!
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Opsec</b>: since we are a relatively small group, we sometimes depend
      on tight security to "punch above our weight" by using surprise. To keep
      good security, don't discuss ongoing or future ops in public spaces.
      If there's another group you think might want to help us, that's great -
      talk to the FC or marshal for the op to see if it's okay to talk to that
      group <b>before</b> you talk to them.
